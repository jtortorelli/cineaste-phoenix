Screenwriter and frequent collaborator with director Ishiro Honda. His darker, more serious works are often in contrast to his contemporary Shinichi Sekizawa, whose screenplays were more light-hearted and optimistic in tone. Mabuchi wrote under the pseudonym Takeshi Kimura for the first half of his career, up until 1965, when he began working under his true name.

Mabuchi dropped out of Kansai University in 1930 and joined the Japanese Communist Party, serving as chairman of the Saga Prefecture chapter.
