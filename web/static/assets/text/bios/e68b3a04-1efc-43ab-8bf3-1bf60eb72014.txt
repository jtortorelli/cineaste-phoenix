Kondo made a reputation for herself in the 50s with her enchanting recordings of children's nursery rhymes. She only appeared in two films: <i>The Invisible Man</i> (1954), offering just a tease of her vocal talents, and <i>Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji Temple</i> (1955), as a servant girl at Musashi Miyamoto's inn, singing outside in the snow.
