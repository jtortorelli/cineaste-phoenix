Long-faced, wide-mouthed supporting actor working exclusively for Toho. Yamada typically played concerned-looking officials in sci-fi films, lingering in the background, although occasionally he was afforded roles with more opportunity for dialogue, such as the defense minister in <i>Godzilla Raids Again</i> (1955), and as a newspaper executive in <i>The Human Vapor</i> (1960). He also played Kyoko Kagawa's father in <i>The Birth of Japan</i> (1959).
