Kuno started at Toho playing small bit parts and walk-ons, culminating in a substantial role in Kihachi Okamoto's <i>Age of Assassins</i> (1967). He was a good friend of actor Yuzo Kayama of the <i>Young Guy</i> series. His most prominent roles in sci-fi were as one of the UN crew in <i>Son of Godzilla</i> (1967) and one of the SY-3 pilots in <i>Destroy All Monsters</i> (1968). Like many other Toho actors, he dropped out of film and transitioned to television in the 70s, and retired from acting altogether in the early 80s. In 2010 he was reportedly running a butcher's shop in Tokyo.
