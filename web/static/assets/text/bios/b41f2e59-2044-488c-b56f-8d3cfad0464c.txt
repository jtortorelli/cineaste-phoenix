Frequent supporting player in Toho's films in the 50s and 60s. His single lead role in sci-fi was as the heroic scientist in <i>Varan the Unbelievable</i> (1958). <i>Varan</i> was originally intended to be a Japanese-American co-production for American TV, and so for budgetary reasons, Toho eschewed A-list talent and cast lesser known actors in prominent roles; hence, Nomura's casting. Aside from <i>Varan</i> he's best seen as one of Hiroshi Koizumi's fellow geologists camped next to the meteorite in <i>Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster</i> (1964). He also gave a lively performance as a reporter in <i>The Human Vapor</i> (1960).
