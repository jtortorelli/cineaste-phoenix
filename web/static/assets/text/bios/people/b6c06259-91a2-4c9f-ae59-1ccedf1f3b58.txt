American actor, younger brother of actor Rex Reason (of <i>This Island Earth</i> fame). Rhodes acted primarily in television, playing guest roles in <i>Bus Stop</i>, <i>Sky King</i>, <i>Sugarfoot</i>, <i>Frontier Doctor</i>, <i>Maverick</i>, <i>Perry Mason</i>, <i>77 Sunset Strip</i>, <i>The Time Tunnel</i>, and <i>Star Trek</i>.

He's best known to film fans as the lead scientist (surrounded by Japanese co-stars) studying King Kong in <i>King Kong Escapes</i> (1967). In an interview with author Stuart Galbraith IV, Reason commented on the extravagant set design of the film's submarine (including an incongruous vase of flowers!) and the experience of being made-up by Japanese make-up artists (lots of eyeliner).

Reason played the role of Daddy Warbucks in the Broadway production of <i>Annie</i>, replacing the original actor Reid Shelton for the remainder of its original run.
