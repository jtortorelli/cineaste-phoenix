Supporting actor frequently cast as scientists or scientists' assistants, reporters or policeman. He is most recognizable for playing Takashi Shimura's assistant in the original <i>Godzilla</i> (1954). His roles rarely had dialogue, and so he was usually seen standing amidst a sea of extras all playing policeman or reporters, depending on the context. One of his more prominent later roles was as the reporter at Mount Fuji narrating the monster showdown at the climax of <i>Destroy All Monsters</i> (1968). He also starred in recurring roles on both <i>Ultra Q</i> (1966) and <i>Ultra Seven</i> (1968), again as scientists.
