Sada is probably best known among genre fans as the school principal attempting to save his students towards the climax of <i>Mothra vs. Godzilla</i> (1964) and as the Mt. Fuji policeman mistaking the rocketship for Rodan in <i>Destroy All Monsters</i> (1968). His most famous role (and his personal favorite) was as the chauffeur whose son is kidnapped in Akira Kurosawa's <i>High and Low</i> (1963).
