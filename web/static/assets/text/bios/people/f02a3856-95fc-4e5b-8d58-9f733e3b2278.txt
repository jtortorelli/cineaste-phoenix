Suit-actor and martial artist, holding a second degree black belt in karate. He became a frequent collaborator and choreographer of monster fights with premiere suit actor Haruo Nakajima, acting opposite Nakajima in <i>Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster</i> (1966, as Ebirah), <i>War of the Gargantuas</i> (1966, as Sanda), <i>King Kong Escapes</i> (1967, as Gorosaurus and Mechani-Kong), and <i>Destroy All Monsters</i> (1968, as Anguirus and Gorosaurus again). He also briefly played Godzilla in <i>Son of Godzilla</i> (1967), after baseball star and intended suit actor Seiji Onaka broke his hand between takes. Nakajima held Sekida in the highest esteem out of all the suit actors he'd worked with.
