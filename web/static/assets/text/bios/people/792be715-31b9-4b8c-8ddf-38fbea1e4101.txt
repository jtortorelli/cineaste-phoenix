Charismatic and handsome actor from Japan's Golden Age of Filmmaking, highly regarded by his contemporaries. Vaguely reminiscent of Gregory Peck.

Hirata was distinguished from his fellow actors in that he had actually completed his college education (at Law school, no less) and had been working full time before he embraced acting. He joined Toho as part of the 5th New Face class. He met fellow actor Kenji Sahara at this time and the two remained close friends until Hirata's death in 1984.

Hirata's most iconic role was his early appearance as the tormented Dr. Serizawa in the original <i>Godzilla</i> film (1954). He wore the trademark eyepatch again for a villainous role in <i>Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster</i> (1966), and during the press conference announcing production of <i>The Return of Godzilla</i> (1984). Serizawa was meant to play the scientist role in that film, but his failing health prevented him from doing so and the role went to Yosuke Natsuki instead. His final film role was as a doomed scientist in <i>Sayonara, Jupiter</i> (1984).

Hirata is also popular in Japan for playing the villain Mr. K on the <i>Rainbowman</i> TV series in the 70s. He made a cameo appearance on the <i>Star Wolf</i> series as a commander in Earth's space force. <i>Star Wolf</i> was later adapted into <i>Fugitive Alien</i> of <i>Mystery Science Theater 3000</i> fame; Hirata is the official being briefed by Joe "Captain Joe" Shishido on the new crew of the <i>Bacchus 3</i>. You can also see Hirata playing a doctor in <i>Latitude Zero</i> (1969) where he tries to deliver all his lines in English and, quite frankly, fails miserably.
