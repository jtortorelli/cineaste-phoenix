She debuted in <i>Virgin's Peak</i> (1950), from a screenplay by Kaneto Shindo. The next year she starred in Shindo's first directorial effort <i>Story of a Beloved Wife</i> (1960), opposite actor Ken Uehara. From then on she appeared regularly in Kaneto Shindo's films, including <i>The Naked Island</i> (1960), which gained worldwide popularity via the Moscow International Film Festival.
