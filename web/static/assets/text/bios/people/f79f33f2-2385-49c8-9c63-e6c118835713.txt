Small, thin, weasely, buggy-eyed actor typically cast as comic relief. Born the son of a vaudeville entertainer in 1922, Omura made his film debut in 1933 at age 11. He joined PCL (later Toho) in 1934. In 1938 he was sent to war, and was away from Japan until the war's end in 1945. His first major post-war film was Akira Kurosawa's <i>Drunken Angel</i> in 1948. Omura would go on to become a frequently used supporting player in both Kurosawa's and Ishiro Honda's films.

Omura is best known as the tourist going after the hat in the crater just before Rodan's appearance in <i>Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster</i> (1964). He also turned in stellar (if brief) performances as an ill-fated sailor in <i>The H-Man</i> (1958) and as the frightened interpreter in <i>King Kong vs. Godzilla</i> (1962).
