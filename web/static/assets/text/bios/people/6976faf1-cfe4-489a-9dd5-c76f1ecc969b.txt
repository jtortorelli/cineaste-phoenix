American director and producer specializing in animation. He's particularly famous for being one-half of the Rankin-Bass partnership that produced stop motion films, especially holiday-themed ones such as <i>Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer</i> (1964) and <i>Here Comes Peter Cottontail</i> (1971).

Rankin was inspired to pursue stop-motion animation through his love of the original <i>King Kong</i> (1933). Incidentally, Rankin's character designs would be built into wooden puppets by artists living in Japan. The Japanese film <i>King Kong Escapes</i> (1967) was essentially a live-action adaptation of Rankin's <i>The King Kong Show</i> (1966), and Rankin was invited by Toho to participate in that production.
