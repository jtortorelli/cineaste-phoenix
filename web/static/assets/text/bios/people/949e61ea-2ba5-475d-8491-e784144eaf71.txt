Best known for playing Shin Hayata, the protagonist and alter-ego of the titular <i>Ultraman</i> (1966) in the original television series. Outside of <i>Ultraman</i> his film roles were comparatively meager, and he typically played seedy gangster-types or henchmen. He's best seen as one of the assassins in <i>Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster</i> (1964). He's also seen speaking some English in <i>Latitude Zero</i> (1969) as one of Cesar Romero's submarine pilots.

Kurobe has cameo roles in Masaaki Tezuka's <i>Godzilla X Megaguirus</i> (2000, as a cabinet official), and in Minoru Kawasaki's quasi-sequel spoof <i>Monster X Strikes Back</i> (2008, alongside actor Yosuke Natsuki).

Kurobe's daughter, actress Takami Yoshimoto, portrayed the female lead in <i>Ultraman Tiga</i> (1996).
