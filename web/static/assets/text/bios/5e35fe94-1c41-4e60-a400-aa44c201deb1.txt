Handsome actor and known automobile enthusiast. Natsuki joined Toho in 1958, and made his first on-screen appearance as one of the witnesses in the first scene of <i>The H-Man</i> that same year. He garnered leading roles across a variety of films, including sci-fi, war movies, period dramas, salaryman comedies, and teen films. In 1965 he appeared in the first of a series of high school dramas on TV. When Toho's contract system dissolved in the early 70s, Natsuki migrated to Mifune Productions.

In 1984, Natsuki was chosen to replace an ailing Akihiko Hirata as the scientist in <i>The Return of Godzilla</i>. He return to the genre again many years later in a cameo in <i>Monster X Strikes Back</i> (2008).

Natsuki is best known to genre fans for playing detectives in both <i>Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster</i> and <i>Dogora, the Space Monster</i> (both 1964). He also played the wayward farmer's son in <i>Yojimbo</i> (1961), who aligns with one of the town's gangs... and who Toshiro Mifune frightens back home at the end of the film.
