The most prolific sci-fi actor on the Toho lot, starring in no less than 13 Godzilla films, up to and including 2004's <i>Godzilla: Final Wars</i>, and many others besides. He was admitted to Toho as part of the New Face program in 1953. The next year he made very brief appearances in the original <i>Godzilla</i> as a reporter and as a lovebird on a cruise ship. His first major lead role was as a miner in <i>Rodan</i> (1956), opposite actress Yumi Shirakawa. They would headline two more films together in the 50s: <i>The Mysterians</i> (1957) and <i>The H-Man</i> (1958). Sahara also worked frequently with actor Akihiko Hirata; the two would remain close personal friends until Hirata's death in 1984.

Sahara was a favorite of both director Ishiro Honda and special effects maestro Eiji Tsuburaya. His frequent appearances in the sci-fi genre earned him the nickname "Mr. Special Effects" around the Toho lot. In 1964 Sahara was part of a select group of Japanese actors appearing in the first Japanese-American co-production, Frank Sinatra's <i>None But the Brave</i>. Shortly afterward he was offered the lead role in Tsuburaya's <i>Ultra Q</i> TV series. Sahara led the show to great success, spurring Tsuburaya to proceed with his <i>Ultraman</i> concept in 1966. Honda, impressed with Sahara's work on <i>Ultra Q</i>, gave Sahara the lead scientist role in <i>War of the Gargantuas</i> (1966) as a reward for the actor's diligence.

Sahara would continue to appear in sci-fi throughout the 90s, mainly as officials in various anti-Godzilla agencies, culminating with <i>Final Wars</i>. He appeared in more Godzilla films than any other actor (although Koichi Ueda sure gave him a run for his money).

Sahara is best known as the greedy villain Torahata from <i>Mothra vs. Godzilla</i> (1964). He also played villainous characters in <i>Matango</i> and <i>Atragon</i> (both 1963). His most unusual role was as an industrial spy possessed by aliens in <i>Space Amoeba</i> (1970, a role usually reserved for his co-star Yoshio Tsuchiya).
