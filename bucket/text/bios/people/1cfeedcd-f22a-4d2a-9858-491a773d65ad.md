<!-- Yutaka Sada -->

Older actor with a perennially worried expression, which was fitting since his characters were often pitted against aliens, H-Men, giant monsters and Frankenstein.

Sada is probably best known among genre fans as the school principal attempting to save his students towards the climax of _Mothra vs. Godzilla_ (1964) and as the Mt. Fuji policeman mistaking the rocketship for Rodan in _Destroy All Monsters_ (1968). His most famous role (and his personal favorite) was as the chauffeur whose son is kidnapped in Akira Kurosawa's _High and Low_ (1963).

Yutaka Sada was last reported alive and well in 2010 by fellow actor Shigeo Kato.
